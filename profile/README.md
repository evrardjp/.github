We’re a community of enthusiasts, professionals, and newcomers passionate about the Cloud Native ecosystem.  
From Kubernetes to containers, observability to edge—if it's part of the CNCF landscape, we're into it.

We foster an **open, welcoming environment**—regardless of background, age, gender, or race.

To reduce confusion and create synergies, we collaborate across these groups and centralize shared resources, communication, and community efforts under Cloud Native Belgium.
